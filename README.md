## Welcome to Conway's Game-of-Life

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science
classic from 1970, a program that simulates a _cellular automaton_
(plural _automata_). It has connections to all kinds of different
aspects of computer science and nature.

A very famous cellular automaton is John Conway's Game of Life. app. 
This game is a class of discrete model known as a Cellular Automaton.

It's made up of a grid of cells (usually 2D, but can be any dimension) that follow a simple set of rules from which complex behaviors can emerge.

## Rules
In the Game of Life, these rules examine each cell of the grid. For each cell, it counts that cell's eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), and then act on that result.

- If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive. Else it dies.
- If the cell is dead and has exactly 3 neighbors, then it comes to life. Else if remains dead.
From those two rules, many types of "creatures" can be created that move around the "landscape".

Note: cells that are off the edge of the grid are typically assumed to be dead.
